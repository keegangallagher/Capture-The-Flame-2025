# Capture-The-Flame-2025
Cybersecurity Hackathon at UIC 2025
**CTF – UIC 2025**

**Competition:**
Used a Steganography decoder for an image 

Found a hidden message in the HTML of a website using inspect

Used a string and put it into a .bf cipher and then used a caesar cypher to find the code

Went to a website inspected it and found a secret link with a function that I ran in the original console that let me win the game and output the flag

Got a code that appeared to be binary but after splitting everything into 8 length each the first number was 1 which was incorrect for binary so all the numbers were swapped and revealed the real code
